R package GORIC (Generalized Order Restricted Information Criterion)

The package provides functions for fitting multivariate linear models or generalized least-square models with order restrictions on the model parameters. Different models can be compared the generalized order restriction criterion, an extension of AIC for order restricted models.

This is a development version with some additional features. A more stable version is availabe on CRAN.
